	# Notes on Tech
	## Hi, I am rash, and this is my opinion on everything techy.
	
	When selecting a specific technology, you can almost always throw away any source on the interwebs. It is either advertising or ranting, and you hardly find anything objective, let alone supported by data.

	There are some good comparisons on the feature level, but most benchmarks are just laughable.

	Mistake number one most articles make is comparison on an absolute level. "A is better than B".  
	For most technology there is no absolute quality to measure, you cannot boil it down to a simple "good" or "bad".  
	Sure, you can identify some stupendiously horrible technology by knock out criterias, but that is mostly it.  
	For anything else, you need to know the application and the circumstances. "A is better than B for X".  
	I am here trying to find a format to compare technology objectively and to take into account the specific application and circumstances.  
	Of course, I cannot just list all circumstances, but I can make the content of the page structured enough to make a objective choice.  
	Now, this is very much a Work In Progress, and I have no idea yet how to format all of this. So, brainstorm time!


	### FORMAT

	The ideal playing field for a tech comparison is free from constraints and would only look at the application.
	Application of technology and effectiveness of its use is one important measure.

	`C is better than Lua for real time systems`

	is pretty clear. Of course, I cannot just make that statement, since I aim to do science here, so I have to argue for it.
	If I would go on, I'd reason that a compiled language is generally faster than an interpreted, and that C has a more predictable execution time than Lua. And I could go on.  
	

	`Roots is better than Typo3 for a blog`

	Now, everyone except the fanboys for one or the other would say:

	`Depends â€¦`

	Because, both are made FOR creating websites, including blogs.  
	But, this is where circumstances come into play. Do you have prior experience with one or both and / or the sourrounding ecosystem / programming language? Does your deployment have any constraints?

	Almost all decisions related to use of a technology are constrained by a multitude of factors, and it is entirely useless if one tech is 5% faster than the other if speed is not of primary concern.

	I will call these factors Environment.  
	Aspects of the techs should also be weighted. 

	#### Experience

	I think, one important factor to look at is experience. Obviously, direct experience with one technology, but also experience in one ecosystem. Switching tech inside one ecosystem is easier than switching to a new one.

	#### Reasons

	Or, what questions are being asked?

	Is there a current tech in use, and has to be replaced?

	Or, for example, does a decision have to be made which tech is going to be used in a new project?

	For the second case, a direct comparison can be made between candidates, rated in regard to the environment.

	For the first case, an additional cost of switching from an already in use technology has to be taken in regard (aka "how much pain do you have with your current techs"). This often constitudes a switch of ecosystem or multiple techs, so relationship between techs is also a factor.

//- ### Notes on Tech is the collection of my opinions.
//- ### Each opinion is rated by objectiveness, depth of study and experience. (Also, out-of-date-iness).

//- This site is not a chronological blog, but perhaps I list the changelogs somewhere.  
//- Sometimes, articles have the warning tag "retrospective", when it has been some time between encounter and writing down of my opinion.

//- My favorite techs currently are nodejs, coffeescript, mongodb, redis, archlinux
